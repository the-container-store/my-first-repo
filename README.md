### Welcome To My First Repository in Git

##Commits
1) First line should only be 50 characters long
1) Subsequent lines should only be 72 lines long
1) The final line should be your story pivotal id enclosed in brachets e.g. (12345)
1) Your messages should give the reason why you made the change to help your future selves 2 yrs from now understand why the work was done

##Pushing to GitHub
Use git push --force-with-lease  when you do need to do a forced push but still ensure you don't overwrite other's work. 
Git's push --force is strongly discouraged as it can destroy other commits already pushed to a shared repository.
